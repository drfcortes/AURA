## üåç Foundational Manifesto

Generative AI can now produce textual, visual, and functional content at scale, with increasing quality and realism. This new paradigm demands robust answers to questions of **authorship**, **integrity**, and **traceability**. The ease of generation must not erase the duty of disclosure.

**AURA** (Attribution & Usage Reporting for AI) proposes a formal, open, and verifiable structure to document and communicate the involvement of AI in the creative process. It is not about limiting usage, but enabling **transparent and reproducible attribution**.

## üéØ Objectives

- Provide a structured and machine-readable format to attribute AI-generated content.
- Support version control, reproduction, and provenance auditing.
- Encourage ethical and transparent authorship practices.
- Enable downstream consumers (journals, institutions, users) to evaluate AI involvement with clarity.
